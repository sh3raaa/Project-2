CCT211: Group Assignment

All three group members contributed equally to the design, coding, and testing of this project.
We worked on the assignment together in person and online multiple times, and whenever someone couldn’t meet, we emailed the updated code back and forth so everyone could review, fix issues, and add features.

The final version of the project reflects shared effort:
	•	We all participated in debugging the update feature
	•	We made decisions together on layout, fonts, and UI changes
	•	Everyone reviewed the code and added comments for clarity
	•	Each member helped with either testing, writing explanations, or fixing small problems
	•	Some work was done in-person while other parts were handled online
  
This project represents equal teamwork from all members of the group.
